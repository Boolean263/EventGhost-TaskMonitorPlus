# EventGhost-TaskMonitorPlus

This program is not very useful on its own. It's a plugin for
[EventGhost](http://www.eventghost.net/).
EventGhost is an automation tool for MS Windows
which listens for events -- whether user-triggered (like the press of a hotkey)
or system events (such as the screensaver activating) -- and runs actions
you specify. (It's like [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) for Android, or
[Cuttlefish](https://launchpad.net/cuttlefish) for Ubuntu.)

## Description

TaskMonitorPlus is a fork/expansion of the Task Monitor (aka simply Task)
plugin for EventGhost. The original Task Monitor plugin generates events
when a window opens, closes, flashes, or gains or loses focus. But the event
contains nothing but the name of the executable which created the window.

TaskMonitorPlus still produces these events, but now they come with a payload.
The `eg.event.payload` produced by an event is an object (named WindowInfo,
if you're curious) with the following attributes and methods:

* `title`: the title of the window
* `window_class`: the internal class name for the window
* `is_visible`: whether the window is visible (technically this is always True
  since Task Monitor ignores invisible windows)
* `is_enabled`: whether the window is enabled (I don't know what this means,
  but it always seems to be true)
* `hwnd`: the internal ID for the window
* `pid`: the process ID for thet executable owning the window
* `name`: the executable name of the process owning the window (same as in
  the event itself)
* `GetParent()`: returns a new object representing the parent of this window
* `Focus()`: directs focus to the window

The final two methods are mainly just proofs of concept. Other methods could
be added, but I didn't want to go overboard with something I don't know if
anyone will use. Likewise, I'm sure there are other properties that could
be useful. I'd love to hear more about them!

The window title can change over the window's lifetime. The `title` attribute
tries to fetch the most recent window title whenever it's accessed, but if it
can't (like if the window has been closed and no longer exists) it returns
the last known title.

## Usage

**You should disable the standard Task Monitor plugin before installing
this one.**

Once you've done that, you can install this plugin and activate it like
any other. If all is well, it should actually replace the standard Task
Monitor plugin in your plugins list.

In case you aren't familiar with the standard Task Monitor plugin, here's
how you can use it: at the bottom of the EventGhost window, uncheck the
checkbox that says "Log only assigned and activated events", then open
or switch to a window which you'd like to take action on. You'll see an
entry appear in the log that looks something like this:

    Task.NewWindow.notepad <title='Untitled - Notepad', window_class='Notepad',...>

You can drag this entry from the log into any macro you've created, to cause
the actions in that macro to be played back the next time that action takes
place.

You can access the payload object from follow-on actions via the
`eg.event.payload` object. For a simple example, to flash an on-screen display
of the current window's title when Notepad opens, you could add the
the EventGhost â†’ Show OSD action to a macro, and enter something like
"New window opened: {eg.event.payload.title}" in the "Text to display" field.

## Downloads and Support

There are no official releases of this plugin yet. To install it, create a
folder in your `Program Files (x86)\EventGhost\Plugins` directory called
TaskMonitorPlus, and copy the `__init__.py` file from this git repo into
that directory.

I accept issues and pull requests from the official GitHub repo for
this project,
[Boolean263/EventGhost-TaskMonitorPlus](https://github.com/Boolean263/EventGhost-TaskMonitorPlus).
However, remember that this is not originally my work.

## History

The original, canonical Task Monitor ships with EventGhost. This version was
copied from the 0.5.0-rc4 release of EventGhost and modified, based on ideas
I had in (and feedback I received on) my
[EventGhost-WindowWatcher](https://github.com/Boolean263/EventGhost-WindowWatcher) plugin.
